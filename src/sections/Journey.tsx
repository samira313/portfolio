           <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
  From <span className="font-bold">2015 to 2021</span>, I worked as an 
  <span className="italic"> Accountant in Iran</span>. During these six years, 
  I gained deep expertise in financial management, bookkeeping, and preparing 
  accurate monthly and annual reports. 
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
  My role required <span className="font-medium">precision, attention to detail, 
  and structured problem-solving</span>, as I handled tasks such as tax 
  calculations, financial systems organization, and compliance with strict 
  regulations.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
  These experiences shaped my ability to think critically, stay organized, and 
  work under pressure â€” qualities that I now apply to my career in 
  <span className="font-bold"> software development</span>, where I combine 
  logical thinking with creativity to build clean and user-friendly applications.
